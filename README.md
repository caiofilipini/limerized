limerized
=========

A [LimeChat](http://limechat.net/mac/) theme that combines [Solarized Dark](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) colors and Limelight styling.

## Background

This theme was based on [https://github.com/rafeco/limechat-solarized](https://github.com/rafeco/limechat-solarized) and [Limelight](http://projects.serenity.de/limelight/).

## Installation

The easiest way is cloning this repository and copying the files to `~/Library/Application Support/LimeChat/Themes` (or `~/Library/Application Support/net.limechat.LimeChat-AppStore/Themes` if you've installed it from the App Store).

If you want to keep up-to-date with future changes, instead of just copying the files, it's easier to create links that point to `Limerized.css` and `Limerized.yaml` where you have cloned the repository. Then when you `git pull` the repo, you automatically get the changes.
